		<h3>Handling payments for your paid events</h3>
		<sup style="color:grey">(Last edited: August 24, 2023. Revision: 1.2)</sup>
		<br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Terms and definitions</h3>
		<p>
			– <b>Paid events</b> — this encompasses webinars, online lectures, conferences, seminars, courses, lessons, and live broadcasts that require payment for participation. Attendees can access and participate in these events only after they‘ve made the necessary payment.
			<br><br>
			– <b>Webinar software MyOwnConference</b> — we are “Akovana LLC“, a service provider specializing in the organization of both free and paid webinars, live broadcasts, web conferences, and more. Our registered address is 18 Djioyi Street, Vilnius, Lithuania, LT-01128.
			<br><br>
			– <b>User</b> — any individual who has agreed to these terms and utilizes the services in accordance with this agreement.
			<br><br>
			– <b>User Agreement</b> — this document, found in the Control Panel, acts as the binding contract between you (the User) and us (the Website), governing the provision of our information services.
			<br><br>
			– <b>User Account, Control Panel, or Dashboard</b> — this is a collection of the User‘s personal data crucial for accessing the services offered by the Website. It also contains files the User has stored on the Website‘s server.
			<br><br>
			– <b>Attendee, Participant or Guest</b> – an individual invited by the User, who compensates the User for access to a paid event hosted by the User via the Website.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>General provisions</h3>
		<p>
			When arranging paid events, the online platform for webinars, live broadcasts, and web conferences, namely “MyOwnConference“, hereinafter referred to as “the Platform“, serves as an intermediary. The platform is entrusted by the User to receive and process payments from attendees participating in the webinar, online lecture, conference, course, or lesson facilitated via the platform‘s services.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			To formalize an agreement with the Platform, the User isn‘t required to sign a physical (hard copy) contract. Merely accepting the terms of this Agreement, by ticking the respective checkbox within the Platform‘s Control Panel when seeking to activate payment acceptance services, is sufficient.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The Platform conscientiously oversees the quality of the User‘s paid events, keeps track of any discontented participants, and manages refunds for previously processed payments if warranted. Accordingly, during the preliminary verification of the User‘s account, the Platform holds the discretion to deny the User‘s request to process payments without stating a specific reason.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			All payments are exclusively accepted and processed via the international payment system, Paysera.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The primary transactional and accepted currency is the Euro (EUR).
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The Platform directs all received payments to a dedicated account, exclusively designed for managing payments from the User‘s webinar attendees.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			To maintain a comprehensive history of interactions with the User, all inquiries and claims pertaining to payment acceptance and processing—including refund requests—are to be submitted via the email address registered to the User‘s account.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Platform fees</h3>
		<p>
			The website applies a <b>10%</b> commission to every successful payment made by participants attending a user‘s paid event.
		</p>
		<p>
			For instance, if you set the entry fee for a webinar at €10 and 10 people attend, generating €10 x 10 = €100 in total payments, you would earn €100 – 10% = €90 after commission.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Bank service fee</h3>
		<p>
			A service fee of €7 is applied only for bank transfers to the user‘s account. This fee is consistently applied without exceptions.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Correspondent bank fees</h3>
		<p>
			These fees are levied by the Correspondent Bank when facilitating the transfer of funds from the website‘s bank account to the user‘s bank account. For IBAN transfers, the fees charged by correspondent banks can range from €10 to €35. There is no fee for SEPA transfers.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			When transferring via the SEPA method, there are no fees.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Receiving payouts</h3>
		<p>
			When a participant makes a successful payment for a webinar, the amount is credited to a dedicated account on our platform. This is then aggregated based on the number of paid webinars and participants. Payments are processed by our platform, but only initiated upon the user‘s request through the Control Panel.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			In accordance with the terms of this Agreement, a <b>10%</b> commission for our platform, as well as a <b>€7</b> fee charged by our bank for processing the money transfer, will be deducted from the user‘s payout.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The net amount after deductions can either be transferred to the user‘s bank account or be applied as credit towards the cost of using our platform‘s services.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<b>Please note!</b> When using the IBAN method, some intermediary banks may levy an additional fee ranging from €10 to €35. We have no control over, nor can we waive these fees. They are automatically deducted when funds are transferred to the user‘s bank account.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Refund request by the User</h3>
		<p>
			Users can request a refund through the Control Panel on our website. This must then be confirmed via the email address associated with the user‘s account.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			To maintain high-quality service, all refund requests from attendees of paid webinars are reviewed and processed semi-automatically by our system. The refund processing time can range from 1 to 7 business days, depending primarily on the bank that serves the webinar attendee.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The service processes refunds immediately upon receiving a request from the user.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Participant refund request</h3>
		<p>
			Our platform processes refund requests from attendees of paid webinars only when they directly contact us through the provided contact form or email address on our website.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			In such instances, we will issue a refund after thoroughly reviewing the attendee‘s explanation for the request and securing an agreement with the account holder (referred to as “User“). Refunds are initiated based on notifications from the User via their Control Panel.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			We issue refunds promptly upon receiving the notification from the User.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			However, if for any reason the User fails to notify us through the Control Panel, our platform reserves the right to process the refund to the attendee independently.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Refund request from the webinar attendee‘s bank</h3>
		<p>
			Such refund requests arise from the bank that serves the attendee of a paid webinar. All payments made by attendees for paid events are fully refundable, adhering to the principle that “The Attendee is Always Right“.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Should a refund request be received directly from an attendee‘s bank, the Website will promptly inform the User. The Website then allows the User 3 business days to address the matter with the attendee and subsequently notify the Website of any agreements reached, providing relevant correspondence and documentation. The Website will then forward these documents to the relevant bank for processing.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<b>Note:</b> Should the Website receive more than 2 refund requests from the bank issuing an attendee‘s card, the Website may exercise its right to disable the User‘s payment acceptance functionality. Additionally, the Website might reverse all previously processed payments and, if deemed necessary, suspend the User‘s account.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Furthermore, if there are numerous complaints from attendees regarding the content or quality of webinars, the Website reserves the right to issue refunds to all attendees without exception. In such cases, the User will not receive the contested funds.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			<b>The website strictly adheres to this rule.</b>
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Rights and obligations of the website</h3>
		<p>
			While the Website strives to ensure the highest possible level of service availability and performance, it cannot be held accountable for any failure or delay in meeting its obligations due to unforeseen circumstances beyond its control. Such circumstances include, but are not limited to: subpar internet connection quality experienced by the User or Participants during webinars, live broadcasts, and web conferences; the absence of essential equipment such as microphones or cameras on the user‘s end; insufficient power of the User‘s device; DDoS attacks targeting data centers utilized by the Website; natural disasters; strikes; acts of war; delays or failures in third-party services, and more.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The Website cannot be held liable for any errors, damages, or other unexpected outcomes that arise from the User‘s or Participant‘s misuse of the provided services.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			In line with its <a href="https://myownconference.com/refund-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Return Policy</a>, the Website disclaims responsibility for any complaints from Participants concerning the poor organization of a paid webinar or any technical mishaps attributable to the User.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The Website reserves the right to suspend or terminate its services without prior notice to the User. This may also involve retaining all proceeds from paid events on the Website‘s account, especially in cases where paid webinars, live broadcasts, or web conferences contain illegal or offensive content.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>User‘s rights and obligations</h3>
		<p>
			The User is personally responsible to the attendees of paid events for their content, quality, and the timely delivery using the services provided by the Website.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The User assumes personal responsibility towards attendees of paid events for any technical issues, glitches, delays, or cancellations related to the organization of the paid webinar.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The User agrees not to use the services of the Website for illegal purposes. Breaching this agreement will result in the immediate suspension of the User‘s account, and any funds accrued from paid events will be retained by the Website.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The User is not permitted to use the Service or its messaging system to send, share, or distribute spam or other unauthorized promotional content. Should attendees file complaints against the User for such unauthorized activities, the Website reserves the right to suspend the User‘s account and retain all funds acquired from paid events on the Website.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Copyright policy</h3>
		<p>
			Users are prohibited from posting or reproducing copyrighted materials or trademarks on the Service without obtaining prior permission from the copyright owners.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Should a user violate this policy, the Website reserves the right to take actions as detailed in the “Rights and Obligations of the Website“ section of this User Agreement.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Limitation of liability</h3>
		<p>
			The Website shall not be held responsible for any damages, including lost profits incurred by Participants or the User, or loss of Participant data due to the negligence of the User, the Website, the Participant, or third parties.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The Website‘s liability to the User is restricted solely to the monetary value of the services the Website has rendered to the User.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			For Participants of paid events, the Website‘s liability is confined solely to the monetary sum received by the User.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The Website offers no assurances to Participants of paid events concerning the accuracy, currentness, or comprehensiveness of the information provided by the User. The User acknowledges that the content or materials they present during paid events might have inaccuracies or errors. The Website shall not be accountable for any inaccuracies or for any lost profits of the User or Participants.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			The Website does not supply Participants with any ancillary documentation, such as invoices or receipts. It is at the User‘s discretion to address this matter independently if deemed necessary.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Disputes</h3>
		<p>
			While the Website strives to address concerns comprehensively, it cannot guarantee a resolution in favor of every User or Participant of paid events. However, we commit to taking all necessary actions and making every effort to resolve any situation or problem promptly. Should disputes arise that necessitate the involvement of public authorities, both the User and the Participant agree to be governed by applicable EU law.
		</p>
		<br><br>
		<h3>Notifications</h3>
		<p>
			Please direct all notifications and inquiries to paid-webinars@myownconference.com. Be sure to provide a detailed description of your concern or any technical issues you‘ve encountered.
